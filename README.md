Every student is assigned to read some consecutive books. The task is to assign books in such a way that the maximum number of pages assigned 
to a student is minimum. 

Input : pages[] = {12, 34, 67, 90} , m = 2
Output : 113
Explanation: There are 2 number of students. Books can be distributed in following fashion : 
1) [12] and [34, 67, 90]
Max number of pages is allocated to student ‘2’ with 34 + 67 + 90 = 191 pages
2) [12, 34] and [67, 90] Max number of pages is allocated to student ‘2’ with 67 + 90 = 157 pages 
3) [12, 34, 67] and [90] Max number of pages is allocated to student ‘1’ with 12 + 34 + 67 = 113 pages
